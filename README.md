# Python yuri clock

Display your system clock on the desktop using tkinter GUIs.

## Setup

This script utilizes the pyglet module to load custom font files into tkinter. If you are running on a linux system and tkinter is not yet installed, you need to install it first. For arch based systems, run

```bash
sudo pacman -S tk
```

Install project dependencies in requirements.txt file
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the main python file on windows cmd/terminal:
```bash
python3 show_time.py
```
